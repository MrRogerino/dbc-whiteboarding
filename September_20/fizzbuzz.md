## FizzBuzz

Ah, FizzBuzz. The algorithm that's probably been [written](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) [about](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) [more](http://codingbat.com/doc/practice/fizzbuzz-code.html) [times](https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-design/fizzbuzz-in-too-much-detail/) than it's actually been asked in an interview.

The premise is simple: write a function that prints every number up to 100. There are three rules:
- If the number is divisible by three, print ```fizz``` instead. 
- If it's divisible by five, print ```buzz```
- If it's divisible by 3 AND 5, print ```fizzbuzz```.

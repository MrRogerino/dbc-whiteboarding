## Second Largest Sum

Given an array of non-sorted numbers, return the second largest sum of any two numbers in the array.

**Note:** You are NOT allowed to use the ```#max``` method

### Examples

```ruby
array = [1,23,4,6,10]
second_largest_sum(array)
=> 29

array = [10,2,5,7,9]
second_largest_sum(array)
=> 17
```

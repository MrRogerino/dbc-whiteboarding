## Expanded Notation

Write a function, ```expanded_form```, that takes a number ```n``` and returns the expanded notation of said number.

For example, the expanded form of ```1337``` is ```1000+300+30+7```.

### Examples
```ruby
expanded_form(12)
=> '10 + 2'
expanded_form(42)
=> '40 + 2'
expanded_form(70304)
=> '70000 + 300 + 4' #note how the tens and thousands place are ignored
```

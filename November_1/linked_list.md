## Introduction to Linked Lists

Today we'll code out one of the most fundamental data structures of computer science: a linked list. Linked lists are used similarly to arrays to store data.  Essentially, a linked list is a series of connected "nodes"- each node contains some data, as well as a pointer to the "next" node (or nothing, if it's at the end of a list). Storing data in this fashion has its advantages and disadvantages compared to an array. For example, insertion and deletion of elements is much more efficient in a linked list compared to an array. What are some other pros and cons of storing data in a linked list?

## One is the Loneliest Number

Write a method ```lonely_number``` which takes an array of numbers. The array will have exactly one unique number- every other number will be repeated at least once. Your method must return the lonely number.

### Examples

```ruby
array = [123,234,123]
lonely_number(another_array)
=> 234

another_array = [2,2,6,3,8,6,2,3]
lonely_number(array)
=> 8
```

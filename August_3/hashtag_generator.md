## Hashtag Generator

The marketing team are spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with out own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
- If the input is a empty string it must return false.
- It must start with a hashtag (#).
- All words must have their first letter capitalized.

Example Input to Output:

```ruby
hashtag_generator("Hello there thanks for trying my Kata")
=>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"

hashtag_generator("Hello World")
=> "#HelloWorld"
```
